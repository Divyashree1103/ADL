Exp create a simple testing angular aplication
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed before you start.

Step 1: Install Angular CLI
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Angular CLI globally:
npm install -g @angular/cli

Step 2: Create a New Angular Project
Run the following command to create a new Angular project:
ng new my-angular-app

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Folder
cd my-angular-app

Step 4: Serve the Application
Run the following command to start the development server and open your application in a web browser:
ng serve

By default, your Angular app will be available at http://localhost:4200/.

Step 5: Create a Simple Component
Open a new terminal window, navigate to your project folder, and run the following command to generate a new component:
ng generate component greeting

This command will create a new folder named greeting with the necessary files for your component.


Step 6: Modify the Component
Open the src/app/greeting/greeting.component.ts file and modify it as follows:

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-greeting',
  templateUrl: './greeting.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./greeting.component.css']
})
export class GreetingComponent implements OnInit {
  message: string = 'Hello, Angular!';

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }
}

Step 7: Use the Component
Open the src/app/app.component.html file and replace its content with:

html
Copy code
<div style="text-align:center">
  <h1>
    Welcome to {{ title }}!
  </h1>
</div>
<app-greeting></app-greeting>
Step 8: Run the Application
Save your changes and go back to the terminal. Make sure the ng serve command is still running, and your changes will be automatically reflected in the browser.

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser. You should see your Angular app displaying the greeting message.
